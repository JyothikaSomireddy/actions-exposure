# SecureStack GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action that analyses your web application for security and availability issues.
When you add this to GitHub Actions we will analyze your web app everytime you deploy to a 
public endpoint and let you know if what you've just deployed is secure and meets your 
requirements.  See below for what types of issues this action scans for.

```
name: Example Workflow Using SecureStack Web Vulnerability Exposure Action
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Web Vulnerability Exposure Analysis Step
        id: exposure
        uses: SecureStackCo/actions-exposure@v0.1.2
        with:
          securestack_api_key: ${{ secrets.SECURESTACK_API_KEY_SECRET }}
          securestack_app_id: <put your application id here>
          severity: critical
          flags: '--dom -r'
```

NOTE - to understand possible values for the action input `flags`, run the SecureStack cli locally:

`$ bloodhound-cli recon --help`

## Retreiving your SecureStack Application ID

1. Log in to [SecureStack](https://app.securestack.com).
2. Open the application you wish to analyse.
3. Copy the value of the application id on the View Application screen.
4. Paste into the value of the `securestack_app_id` action input for the step using the SecureStack action in your workflow.

## What vulnerabilities do we find?
1. Scans web application for out of date and vulnerable applicaiton components
2. Identifies whether basic security controls like WAF, firewalls, and security headers are being used
3. Finds all public facing assets & helps you understand your application attack surface
4. Identifies misconfigurations in existing WAF or CDN
5. Identifies if app is using CSP or security headers and whether they're working
6. Finds WAF bypass attacks for Akamai, Cloudflare & Imperva
