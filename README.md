# SecureStack GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action that analyses your web application for security and availability issues.
When you add this to GitHub Actions we will analyze your web app everytime you deploy to a 
public endpoint and let you know if what you've just deployed is secure and meets your 
requirements.
